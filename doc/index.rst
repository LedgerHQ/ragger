The Ragger framework
====================

``Ragger`` is a Python framework which aims at simplifying the test and overall
automatic manipulation of applications running on Ledger devices: NanoS, NanoS+,
NanoX, Stax and Flex.

It is composed of a tiny wrapper around other Ledger's libraries which abstract
and/or provide access to Ledger's cold wallet, and higher-level classes allowing
to develop complex behaviors on devices.
