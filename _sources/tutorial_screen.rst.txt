Complex UI management - Stax
============================

Interacting programmatically with an application tends to be a non-trivial
thing, as complex processes (like performing a complete transaction) have to be
implemented through low-level actions on the device: forging bytes payloads (the
:term:`APDUs <APDU>`), triggering the buttons or the screen at the right time,
in the right places, in the right order, comparing runtime screens with expected
ones, ...

All these actions can be automated, with ``Ragger``. When speaking more
specifically about the UI, we saw :ref:`previously
<tutorial_conftest_navigation>` that ``Ragger`` had some capabilities allowing
to cope with simple physical interactions (like on the Nano devices: only two
buttons). But what to do with more complex interfaces?

In particular, interacting with the Stax screen can be bothersome. It is hard to
track of button positions, pages layouts and such.

Study case
----------

For instance let's imagine you develop an application with a welcome screen with
a "start" button in the center, a "quit" button beneath and an "info" button on
the top right.

If you click on the "quit" button, well the application shuts down.

If you click on the "info" button the screen shows some application infos, with
a clickable "return" button on the lower center, which brings back to the
previous, welcome screen.

.. thumbnail:: images/stax_welcome.png
   :group: stax_base_group
   :width: 30%

.. thumbnail:: images/stax_infos.png
   :group: stax_base_group
   :width: 30%

This layouts has three clickable buttons. Low-level interaction with them would
be something like:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # going into the "info" screen
   backend.touch_finger(197, 606)

   # going back into the "welcome" screen
   backend.touch_finger(197, 606)

   # quitting the application
   backend.touch_finger(342, 55)


This does not look very complicated. However, this is just obfuscated code.
Without extended comment, you can't ask someone to understand or remember what
this code does. This is a guaranteed path to hard to maintain code.

Moreover, these pixel positions are not guaranteed to last. If the SDK chooses
to change some button position, or if higher-level graphic objects (such as
``Pages`` or ``UseCase``) changes the position - nothing prevents them to move
the "info" button to the top left -, all this code becomes deprecated.


That's why ``Ragger`` mimics the Stax SDK graphics library and provides
:term:`Layout` and :term:`Use Case` (:term:`Page` will also come soon) classes
that keep track of every interactive screen elements and expose meaningful
methods to interact with them.

Layouts
'''''''

``Ragger``'s :mod:`Layouts <ragger.firmware.stax.layouts>` and
:mod:`UseCases <ragger.firmware.stax.use_cases>` allows to quickly describe an
application screens and its attached behavior in a purely declarative way,
thanks to the :class:`MetaScreen <ragger.firmware.stax.screen.MetaScreen>`
metaclass. For instance, with the previously described application:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:


   from ragger.firmware.stax.screen import MetaScreen
   from ragger.firmware.stax.layouts import CancelFooter, ExitFooter, InfoHeader

   class RecoveryAppScreen(metaclass=MetaScreen)
       layout_quit = ExitFooter
       layout_go_to_info_page = InfoHeader
       layout_return_to_welcome_page = CancelFooter

The metaclass will automatically detect all variables starting with ``layout_``
and create related attributes when the ``RecoveryAppScreen`` will be
instantiated. This latter will need - like a lot of ``Ragger`` classes - a
:term:`backend` and a :term:`firmware` as arguments.

Once instantiated, the created screen can be interacted with in a more flexible
way than if positions were still necessary:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # let's say we still have a ``backend`` and a ``firmware`` fixture
   screen = RecoveryAppScreen(backend, firmware)

   # the application starts on the "welcome" page, from here we can either quit
   # the application, or go to the "info" page

   # this method call will trigger a ``finger_touch`` with the positions related
   # to the "info" centered lower button
   screen.go_to_info_page.tap()

   # now the application is on the "info" screen, it can only go back to the
   # "welcome" page
   screen.return_to_welcome_page.tap()

   # now the application is back on the "welcome" screen. Let's quit
   screen.quit.tap()

   # the application is now stopped

.. note::

   You may have noticed that the two centered lower buttons (the welcome page
   "quit" button and the info page "return" button) are exactly at the same
   ``(x, y)`` positions, so why bother declaring them twice?

   First of all, the buttons may be at the same place, but they don't carry the
   same purpose, and it is a good idea to reflect that on the code.

   Second, if in a future version the Stax design changes and one of these
   button moves somewhere else on the screen's footer, **the layouts will be
   updated accordingly** in ``Ragger``, and the ``CancelFooter`` or ``ExitFooter``
   will still be valid, hence all code using this class remains valid too.

   If these arguments does not convince you, ``Ragger`` provides purely
   positional Layouts, and you can use ``CenteredFooter`` in replacement of both
   of these Layouts.

Use cases
'''''''''

But this is not simple enough *yet*. The previously shown screens are very
common, so common in fact that the SDK provides dedicated high-level
:term:`Use Cases <Use Case>` to simplify their creation.

In this case, there is two. In the SDK, they are named:

- ``nbgl_useCaseHome``, which displays the "welcome" page, while allowing to
  access an "info" or "settings" page.
- ``nbgl_useCaseSettings``, which displays an "info" or "settings" page. This
  Use Case is very convenient when dealing with multiple info or settings which
  need several pages to be displayed (hence needs navigation buttons).

``Ragger`` replicates these Use Cases, and provides more meaningful methods on
top of them. Using Use Cases is very similar to Layouts; they need to be
declared as attribute of a class using the :class:`MetaScreen` metaclass,
and start with ``use_case_``:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from ragger.firmware.stax.screen import MetaScreen
   from ragger.firmware.stax.use_case import UseCaseHome, UseCaseSettings

   class RecoveryAppScreen(metaclass=MetaScreen)
       use_case_welcome = UseCaseHome
       use_case_info = UseCaseSettings

   # let's say we still have a ``backend`` and a ``firmware`` fixture
   screen = RecoveryAppScreen(backend, firmware)

   # the application starts on the "welcome" page, from here we can either quit
   # the application, or go to the "info" page

   # this method call will trigger a ``finger_touch`` with the positions related
   # to the "info" centered lower button
   screen.welcome.info()

   # now the application is on the "info" screen, it can only go back to the
   # "welcome" page.
   # if the info needed to be shown on several pages, this Use Case also
   # provides navigation methods, ``.next`` and ``.back``
   screen.info.exit()

   # now the application is back on the "welcome" screen. Let's quit
   screen.welcome.quit()

   # the application is now stopped


All-in-one solution: the ``FullScreen``
---------------------------------------

All these classes helps you tailoring a fairly elegant and straight-forward
client with meaningful and easy to write screen controls. However if you don't
feel like crafting you own screen representation, ``Ragger`` comes with a
:class:`FullScreen <ragger.firmware.stax.screen.FullScreen>` class
which embeds every existing :term:`Layout` and :term:`Use Case`.

It can be used to quickly instantiate a screen which could work with any
application screen, however of course, all action on this class are not
guaranteed to trigger a desired reaction (or no reaction at all) on the
application screen, as declared button can be totally fictional.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from ragger.firmware.stax.screen import FullScreen

   screen = FullScreen(backend, firmware)

   # these use case methods will work in our case
   screen.home.info()
   screen.settings.exit()
   screen.welcome.quit()

   # layouts are also available, on these method will work too
   screen.info_footer.tap()
   screen.exit_footer.tap()
   screen.exit_header.tap()

   # this, however, will just randomly click on the screen and may or may not
   # trigger totally unrelated reaction
   screen.letter_only_keyboard.write("hello world!")
